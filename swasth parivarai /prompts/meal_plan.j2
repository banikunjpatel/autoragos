Generate a 7-day Indian meal plan starting on {{ week_start }}.

Context:
- Region of India: {{ region }}
- Diet type (shared): {{ diet_type }}  # "veg" | "non_veg" | "eggs_ok"
- Household: {{ household.type }} (size={{ household.size }})
- Members & doshas:
{% for m in household.members -%}
  - {{ m.name }}: {{ m.dosha }}
{% endfor %}

Rules:
1) For each day, provide breakfast, lunch, and dinner with concise dish names.
2) Each meal must include a realistic recipe:
   - Ingredients: metric units (g, kg, ml, L, pcs). 6–16 items; region-appropriate spices.
   - Steps: 4–10 short lines.
   - Include prep_mins and cook_mins.
3) Portioning: set every meal's "serving_size" to the household size ({{ household.size }}).
4) Dosha balancing:
   - vata: warm, moist, grounding; reduce raw/cold.
   - pitta: cooling, less chili/tomato; use coconut, coriander, fennel.
   - kapha: light, warming, less oil/dairy; more bitter greens, legumes.
   Add brief adjustments in the day's "notes" when relevant.
5) Diet constraints: never include restricted ingredients for the chosen diet type.
6) Uniqueness:
   - Do NOT repeat any dish name within this 7-day plan.
   - Avoid the following recently used dishes entirely: {{ avoid_dishes|join(", ") if avoid_dishes else "none" }}.
7) Grocery list:
   - Aggregate ingredients for the whole week; sum by (name, unit).
   - Category one of: produce, grains, dairy, spices, protein, staples, bakery, condiments, other.
